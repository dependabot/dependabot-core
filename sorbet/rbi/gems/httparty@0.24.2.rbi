# == Common Request Options
# Request methods (get, post, patch, put, delete, head, options) all take a common set of options. These are:
#
# [:+body+:] Body of the request. If passed an object that responds to #to_hash, will try to normalize it first, by default passing it to ActiveSupport::to_params. Any other kind of object will get used as-is.
# [:+http_proxyaddr+:] Address of proxy server to use.
# [:+http_proxyport+:]  Port of proxy server to use.
# [:+http_proxyuser+:] User for proxy server authentication.
# [:+http_proxypass+:] Password for proxy server authentication.
# [:+limit+:] Maximum number of redirects to follow. Takes precedences over :+no_follow+.
# [:+query+:] Query string, or an object that responds to #to_hash representing it. Normalized according to the same rules as :+body+. If you specify this on a POST, you must use an object which responds to #to_hash. See also HTTParty::ClassMethods.default_params.
# [:+timeout+:] Timeout for opening connection and reading data.
# [:+local_host+:] Local address to bind to before connecting.
# [:+local_port+:] Local port to bind to before connecting.
# [:+body_stream+:] Allow streaming to a REST server to specify a body_stream.
# [:+stream_body+:] When downloading with a block, avoids accumulating the response in memory. When uploading files, streams the request body to reduce memory usage (opt-in).
# [:+multipart+:] Force content-type to be multipart
#
# There are also another set of options with names corresponding to various class methods. The methods in question are those that let you set a class-wide default, and the options override the defaults on a request-by-request basis. Those options are:
# * :+base_uri+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.base_uri.
# * :+basic_auth+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.basic_auth. Only one of :+basic_auth+ and :+digest_auth+ can be used at a time; if you try using both, you'll get an ArgumentError.
# * :+debug_output+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.debug_output.
# * :+digest_auth+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.digest_auth. Only one of :+basic_auth+ and :+digest_auth+ can be used at a time; if you try using both, you'll get an ArgumentError.
# * :+format+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.format.
# * :+headers+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.headers. Must be a an object which responds to #to_hash.
# * :+maintain_method_across_redirects+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.maintain_method_across_redirects.
# * :+no_follow+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.no_follow.
# * :+parser+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.parser.
# * :+uri_adapter+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.uri_adapter
# * :+connection_adapter+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.connection_adapter.
# * :+pem+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.pem.
# * :+query_string_normalizer+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.query_string_normalizer
# * :+ssl_ca_file+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.ssl_ca_file.
# * :+ssl_ca_path+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.ssl_ca_path.

# Default connection adapter that returns a new Net::HTTP each time
#
# == Custom Connection Factories
#
# If you like to implement your own connection adapter, subclassing
# HTTParty::ConnectionAdapter will make it easier. Just override
# the #connection method. The uri and options attributes will have
# all the info you need to construct your http connection. Whatever
# you return from your connection method needs to adhere to the
# Net::HTTP interface as this is what HTTParty expects.
#
# === Configuration
# There is lots of configuration data available for your connection adapter
# in the #options attribute. It is up to you to interpret them within your
# connection adapter. Take a look at the implementation of
# HTTParty::ConnectionAdapter#connection for examples of how they are used.
# The keys used in options are
# * :+timeout+: timeout in seconds
# * :+open_timeout+: http connection open_timeout in seconds, overrides timeout if set
# * :+read_timeout+: http connection read_timeout in seconds, overrides timeout if set
# * :+write_timeout+: http connection write_timeout in seconds, overrides timeout if set (Ruby >= 2.6.0 required)
# * :+debug_output+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.debug_output.
# * :+cert_store+: contains certificate data. see method 'attach_ssl_certificates'
# * :+pem+: contains pem client certificate data. see method 'attach_ssl_certificates'
# * :+p12+: contains PKCS12 client client certificate data.  see method 'attach_ssl_certificates'
# * :+verify+: verify the server’s certificate against the ca certificate.
# * :+verify_peer+: set to false to turn off server verification but still send client certificate
# * :+ssl_ca_file+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.ssl_ca_file.
# * :+ssl_ca_path+: see HTTParty::ClassMethods.ssl_ca_path.
# * :+ssl_version+: SSL versions to allow. see method 'attach_ssl_certificates'
# * :+ciphers+: The list of SSL ciphers to support
# * :+connection_adapter_options+: contains the hash you passed to HTTParty.connection_adapter when you configured your connection adapter
# * :+local_host+: The local address to bind to
# * :+local_port+: The local port to bind to
# * :+http_proxyaddr+: HTTP Proxy address
# * :+http_proxyport+: HTTP Proxy port
# * :+http_proxyuser+: HTTP Proxy user
# * :+http_proxypass+: HTTP Proxy password
#
# === Inherited methods
# * :+clean_host+: Method used to sanitize host names
#
# @example count number of http calls
#   class CountingConnectionAdapter < HTTParty::ConnectionAdapter
#   @@count = 0
#
#   self.count
#   @@count
#   end
#
#   def connection
#   self.count += 1
#   super
#   end
#   end
# @example log the uri and options
#   class LoggingConnectionAdapter < HTTParty::ConnectionAdapter
#   def connection
#   puts uri
#   puts options
#   Net::HTTP.new(uri)
#   end
