# A thread-safe subclass of Array. This version locks against the object
# itself for every method call, ensuring only one thread can be reading
# or writing at a time. This includes iteration methods like `#each`.
#
# @note `a += b` is **not** a **thread-safe** operation on
#   `Concurrent::Array`. It reads array `a`, then it creates new `Concurrent::Array`
#   which is concatenation of `a` and `b`, then it writes the concatenation to `a`.
#   The read and write are independent operations they do not form a single atomic
#   operation therefore when two `+=` operations are executed concurrently updates
#   may be lost. Use `#concat` instead.
