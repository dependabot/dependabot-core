# Dependabot Updater

This is an internal component that GitHub uses to run Dependabot, it's not
considered useful outside of this internal usage, and we also are currently not
considering any contributions to this part of the codebase to make it more
generic. We do however use it to run some end-to-end tests against the rest of
the codebase, so we can ensure that things still work when we deploy them.

This component communicates with an API that is only accessible inside the
GitHub network, and so is not generally accessible.

## Setup

To work on the Updater, you will need to start a Docker dev shell:

```zsh
➜ bin/docker-dev-shell updater  # the docker-dev-shell internally maps 'updater' to the 'bundler' ecosystem image
[dependabot-core-dev] ~ $ cd dependabot-updater/
[dependabot-core-dev] ~/dependabot-updater $ bundle
```

## Tests

We run [rspec](https://rspec.info/) tests in the docker dev shell:

```zsh
[dependabot-core-dev] ~/dependabot-updater $ bundle exec rspec
```

You can run an individual test file like so:

```zsh
[dependabot-core-dev] ~/dependabot-updater $ bundle exec rspec spec/dependabot/integration_spec.rb
```

A small number of tests hit the GitHub API, so you will need to set the envvar
`DEPENDABOT_TEST_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a Personal Access Token with the full `repo`
scope.

```zsh
# keep secrets from being stored in shell history by prefixing with a space
export HISTCONTROL=ignorespace
export  DEPENDABOT_TEST_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
# The DEPENDABOT_TEST_ACCESS_TOKEN will be forwarded to the dev shell container
➜ bin/docker-dev-shell bundler
```

### VCR

In order to avoid network calls, we use [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) to maintain
fixtures for the remote services we interact with.

If you are adding a new test that makes network calls, please ensure you record a new fixture.

:warning: At time of writing, **our tests will not fail if a fixture is missing**. See: `spec/spec_helper.rb`

#### Recording new fixtures

If you've added a new test which has the `vcr: true` metadata, you can record a fixture for just those changes like so:

```zsh
[dependabot-core-dev] ~/dependabot-updater $ VCR=new_episodes bundle exec rspec
```

#### Updating existing fixtures

If you need to update existing fixtures, you can use the `all` flag like so:

```zsh
[dependabot-core-dev] ~/dependabot-updater $ VCR=new_episodes bundle exec rspec
```
