Support ActiveRecord transition classes which don't include `Statesman::Adapters::ActiveRecordTransition`, and thus don't have a `.updated_timestamp_column` method (see [#310](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gocardless/statesman/issues/310) for further details) (patch by [[**timrogers**](https://github.com/timrogers)](https://github.com/timrogers))\n> \n> ## v3.4.0, 12 February 2018\n> \n> - When unsetting the `most_recent` flag during a transition, don't assume that transitions have an `updated_at` attribute, but rather allow the \"updated timestamp column\" to be re-configured or disabled entirely (patch by [[**timrogers**](https://github.com/timrogers)](https://github.com/timrogers))\n> \n> ## v3.3.0, 5 January 2018\n> \n> -
