# Main Rakefile for dependabot-core
#
# This file serves as the entry point for all Rake tasks.
# Task definitions are organized in the rakelib/ directory for better
# maintainability and modularity.
#
# The rakelib/ directory structure:
# - rakelib/gems.rake: Tasks for building and releasing gems
# - rakelib/rubocop.rake: Tasks for RuboCop configuration management
# - rakelib/support/helpers.rb: Shared helper methods and constants
#
# Rake automatically loads all .rake files from the rakelib/ directory.
