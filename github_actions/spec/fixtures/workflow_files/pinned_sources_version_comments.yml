    # The versions in the comment for the next action won't be updated.
    # The first version could be updated, but it's difficult to create
    # a heuristic that recognizes the first version as a version alias
    # for the SHA commit, and the second version as a concrete version
    # that shouldn't change. For simplicity, we don't update either.

    # This is pinned to the version before v2.1.0, so the comment is incorrect.
    # Rather than failing to update, it will just leave the comment as-is.
