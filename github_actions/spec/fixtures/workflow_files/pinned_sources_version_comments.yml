    - uses: actions/checkout@01aecc#v2.1.0 # this shouldn't be updated, because the version is part of the ref, not a comment.

    # The version in the comment for the next action shouldn't be updated
    # because it refers to past behavior.
    - uses: actions/checkout@01aecccf739ca6ff86c0539fbc67a7a5007bbc81 # Versions older than v2.1.0 have a security vulnerability

    # The versions in the comment for the next action won't be updated.
    # The first version could be updated, but it's difficult to create
    # a heuristic that recognizes the first version as a version alias
    # for the SHA commit, and the second version as a concrete version
    # that shouldn't change. For simplicity, we don't update either.
