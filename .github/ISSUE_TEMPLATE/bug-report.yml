        For support on the GitHub-integrated Dependabot service, please contact [GitHub support](https://support.github.com/).
        This issue-tracker is meant for issues related to Dependabot's updating logic, a good rule of thumb is that if you have questions about the _diff_ in a PR, it belongs here, otherwise the GitHub support team is best equipped to help you.

        The more information you can provide, the easier it will be to reproduce the issue and find a fix.
