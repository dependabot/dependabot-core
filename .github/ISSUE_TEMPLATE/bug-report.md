<!-- This issue-tracker is meant for issues related to Dependabot's updating logic, a good rule of thumb is that if you have questions about the _diff_ in a PR, it belongs here, otherwise the GitHub support team is best equipped to help you -->

<!-- The more information you can provide, the easier it will be to reproduce the issue and find a fix -->

**Package ecosystem**
<!-- npm, docker, bundler, etc. -->
**Package manager version**
<!-- If applicable, specify the package manager version you're using (e.g., npm 7.1, pip-compile 5.0, etc.) -->

**What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw**
