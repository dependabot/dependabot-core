# Auto-Linting Workflow

This directory contains an auto-linting workflow that automatically applies code fixes to pull requests.

## Files
- `auto-lint.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow that runs RuboCop and ESLint with auto-fix

## Purpose
Reduces manual linting overhead by automatically fixing style and formatting issues in pull requests.

See [AUTO_LINT_DOCUMENTATION.md] for detailed information about the implementation.
