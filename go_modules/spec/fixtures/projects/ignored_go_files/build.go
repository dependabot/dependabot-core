// This file includes both old style 1.16 and new style 1.17 build tags.
// Since 1.17 is a transition from old to new style, `go fix` will put both
// styles into a file. From 1.18 onwards, `go fix` only includes the new style,
// however, the old style are still supported for backwards compatibility reasons.
